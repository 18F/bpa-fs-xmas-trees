## Background:
The U.S. Forest Service is engaged in an ongoing effort to modernize and simplify their permitting processes. One facet of this effort is [an online permitting application](https://github.com/18F/fs-online-permitting), or making the applications for many Forest Service permits available online.

### What we're hoping to get built:

The objective of this Performance Work Statement is to develop an online permitting module focused on Christmas tree sales. Every winter, many national forests sell “tags” for Christmas tree cutting (“tag” is the term for a Christmas-tree-specific permit). After purchasing a tag, members of the public can travel to parts of nearby national forests to cut down a tree from a designated area. Currently, the tags are only available for purchase at Forest Service offices and local retailers. The application being developed will enable people to purchase and print Christmas tree tags from home, offering a much better user experience.

### Key personnel:
 
Details about what we're looking for from Key Personnel are explained in [section 4.2 of our RFQ](solicitation_documents/RFQ.md#42-key-personnel).
 
-   **Product manager**
-   **Interaction designer / user researcher / usability tester**
-   **Offerors must choose only one of any of these three labor categories as the third key personnel position: technical architect / backend developer / frontend developer**
-   **Offerors must choose only one of any of these three labor categories as the fourth key personnel position: Writer / Content Designer / Content Strategist**


### Period of performance

There will be a Base Period of 6 months and a 3 month option period. Details, including the official start date, are explained in [section 8.1.2 of our RFQ](solicitation_documents/RFQ.md#812-period-place-and-hours-of-performance).
